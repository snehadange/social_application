Implement In-order Tree Traversal to print all nodes of a Binary Tree.

Algorithm:-

1.traverse inorder on left subtree.
2.visit the root.
3.traverse inorder on right  subtree


     15
    /  \
   10   34
   /     /\
   8    22 30

output:8,10,15,22,34,30



Given 2 sorted arrays A and B with n and m elements respectively. A has enough space at the end of the array to fit in all elements of B. Write an algorithm to merge the elements of A and B ensuring the resultant A is sorted as well. The code cannot use an extra array.
Input:A = 1 3 5 6 8 
---B = 0 2 10
Output: A = 0 1 2 3 5 6 8 10

Algorithm:-

1.move m element into n element.
2.Divide n element for example [1,3,5,6] &[8,0,2,10]
3.Divide this two group into 4 group.
4.pick first element campare with another sort it to end of n element.
5.Repeat until list is sorted.
